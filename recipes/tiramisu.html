    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="tiramisu description">Tiramisu has Italian origins. The famous Italian restaurateur Ado Campeol is credited with its invention in the 1970s. In fact, he was widely known as "the father of tiramisu." The word "tiramisu" translates to "pick-me-up."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks and sugar together in a medium saucepan until well blended.</li>

        <li>Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>

        <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>

        <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>

        <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>

        <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture. Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish.</li>

        <li>Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more.</li>
