    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="spaghetti description">After listening to Stanley Tucci lose his mind about this pasta and calling it life-changing and one of the best things he's ever eaten, I decided I'd give it a try. The results were amazing and the key to getting the toasted sweet taste of the zucchini was deep-frying it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
        <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.</li>

        <li>Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.</li>

        <li>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.</li>

        <li>Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.</li>

        <li>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.</li>
